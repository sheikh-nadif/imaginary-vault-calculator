# imaginary-vault-calculator
<!--  
Code Purpose: This program models a financial scenario where an initial vault of money is subject to daily transformations. 
Each day, the vault amount is multiplied by the sum of its digits, ensuring that the sum remains a single digit. 
Additionally, the program calculates and displays the equivalent values of the vault in different currencies
(EUR and USD) based on specified exchange rates. 
The goal is to track how the vault's value changes over a specified time period, 
considering both numerical and word representations of the amount.
